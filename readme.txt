Publish your FitBit statistics on your WordPress blog.

== Description ==

Currently:

* A shortcode for "heartrate" which takes a "date" parameter and prints a simple list of time spent in each heart rate zone for the day
* A shortcode for "steps" which prints a graph of steps taken over a 7 day period before the given "date"
* A shortcake for "goals" which prints a table of daily and weekly goals
See the "Usage" section for an example.

The hope is that eventually this plugin will provide the following functionality:

* Sidebar Widgets which display fitness statistics (e.g. heart rate over time)
* Post types which post to FitBit, e.g. meals
* Shortcodes to include graphs and tables of fitbit data in posts
